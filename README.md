# Helios Engine

The aim of this project was to build a custom Game Engine from scratch using OpenGL to develop
my Programming skills while building a fun project that i can use for simple games and tech demos.

The goal is to get a robust but simple Engine running and able to use it to run a game of Asteroids.

In the future, i hope to keep on developing the Engine to include more features and eventually expand
into fully lit, rigged and interactive 3D games and modelling.
